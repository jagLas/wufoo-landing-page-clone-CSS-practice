# wufoo-landing-page-clone-CSS-practice
This practice was to copy the landing page of a provided site for App Academy. The goal was to be as pixel perfect as possible.
This practice aims to achieve that as closely as possible, but there are some limitations:

- the webfont used appears to be a paid font, and not a free one.
- some favicons also appear to be proprietary 
- frontend javascript has not been covered so some things have not been recreated:
  - the carousel of testimonials
  - pop up menus, such as the mobile menu and the hover over on the template nav link
  - text changing on hover

The site being used as a wireframe is wufoo.com. At the time of this writing, it appears that there have already been some changes made to the landing page, e.g., two buttons have been added since the completion of this practice.
